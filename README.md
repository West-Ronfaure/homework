# Homework

Weekly task tracker for FFXI Horizon Server.

This addon tracks your weekly objectives and ENM timers. It was created specifically for Horizon Server due to differences in EcoWarrior mechanics and includes tracking for the custom Highwind NM.

## Tracked Tasks
- EcoWarrior (with nation rotation)
- Highwind
- UnInvited
- CookBook
- SpiceGals
- X'sKnife

## Features
- Multi-character support
- Auto-detects progress via Key Items
- Auto-resets weekly
- ENM/Limbus timers
- ImGui window and chat commands

## Commands
- `/hw` - Toggle window
- `/hw help` - Full command list

## Setup
- Add `/addon load homework` to your `scripts/default.txt` file to load it automatically on startup. This addon relies on Key Item changes and NPC conversations to track progress, so it must be running at all times.
- Speak to Eeko-Weeko in Ru'Lude Gardens once to initialize the EcoWarrior nation rotation.
